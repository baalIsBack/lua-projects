# GameJam
This project was born out of a small private GameJam.
The development cycle will be broken into two alternating phases consisting of a [fast jam-driven phase](#the-jam) and [slower cleanup phase](#the-cleanup)

## The Jamüçì
This phase is focused on fast jam-driven development. New features are added during the jam. Code quality is of less importance in this step. Jams are planned at irregular intervals with a fixed time limit to increas productivity by deadline.

## The Cleanupüßπ
This phase is followed by a jam session to allow for cleanup, best-practices and bug-fixess to find time into the product. The timer interval between each jam is considered the cleanup phase. Feature additions are discouraged but creation of issues and ideas is encouraged.
